RockSys is a lightweight edge-deployment system for lithology identification and uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) prediction.
This release includes a lithology classification model, a UCS prediction model, model version management, and a simple web UI.
Engineers do not need to install Python; Docker Desktop is sufficient to run it.
